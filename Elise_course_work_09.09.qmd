# The description of the data used in the study

*The survey used data collected in spring 2025 from four cities in four countries*

*Here we can see a mind map on a totally different topic.* See the mind map in @fig-one

# Download the file

```{r}
download.file(
  url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elisejalonen/eitcourse/main/people.csv",
  destfile = "people.csv")
```

## *Check what the data looks like*

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
#install.packages("maps")
library(maps)
#install.packages("countrycode")
library(countrycode)

people <- read.csv("people.csv")
head(people)
```

*Remove all data that isn't right*

```{r}
people_unique <- people %>% distinct()

nrow(people_unique)
str(people_unique)
```

*Check which animals are the most popular*

```{r}
people_unique %>% count(animal, sort = TRUE)
```

*Check which countries are people from*

```{r}
